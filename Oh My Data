Challenge Description:
﻿"CyberNT" is a large journalism company that reports the latest
cybersecurity news. Several months ago, the company discovered that its website was
hacked and are sure that data was leaked. However, they are not certain which accounts were compromised and therefore took measures to secure as many accounts as possible. 
To be on the safe side, they hired you, a cybersecurity specialist, to verify that the incident was mitigated properly.

Your goals
☛ You were provided with the user and password 'student:CyberNT88#!' to reconnect if needed.
☛ Use OSINT to locate the leaked credentials.
☛ Determine if any account is still compromised.

Process:
We will start by opening the browser and exploring the site.
In the video we saw the name 'stikked' mentioned in an HTML script, so we should keep a lookout for that name.
If we go to the news section and to 'Data Leaks', we will see that very name mentioned as a link. Clicking it will direct us to their site. There we can search for the name 'CyberNT' as that is the name of the hacked site.
This will reveal a list of leaked email accounts and their passwords.

We will download this as a txt file. Edit the text file with 'nano' and replace all "--" with ":", so it will be more compatible with Hydra.

Finally, we will use Hydra to brute-force all the users to find at least one that wasn't disabled and can still access the site
