Challenge Description:

A couple of days ago, a guy claiming to be a network tech came to our colleague and said he had to review his network configuration. Since then, your colleague complained about abnormal behavior in this system. At first, he thought it was merely his lack of experience with Ubuntu. However, soon enough, he began suspecting the issue had something to do with the supposed network technician. He turned to you for advice on how to check the system more thoroughly. 
Your goals are:
☛ Find the reason for the abnormal activity in the system.
☛ Find all possible information about the  attacker.
☛ Find any malicious traces the attacker left in the system.

Process:
To solve this issue, we first ran the command 'netstat -ano' , which will give us  a foreign IP in the response that we must check.
We need to run 'curl [foreign IP]' in order to try to gain more information about it. Curling all other IP's will give us nothing of value.

And we will find the first part of the flag.

Next step is to run 'ps -x'  in order to see and find all current processes in the machine.
We will notice that there is a process from /bin/bash /tmp/c8WeUfS34K.sh which is suspicious

Reading the file with cat will reveal the 2nd part of the flag
