Challenge Description: 
"Touch the Sky," a small flight company for cheap flights, has suffered several DoS attacks in the last few months. Despite numerous checks, they were not able to pinpoint the cause of the DOS.
Furthermore, attempts to contact the programmer who originally built the site failed as he is not available
As a last resort, the company decided to hire you in an attempt to identify the possible cause of the occasional DoS.

Your goals
â˜› Find a way to overload the application to get the flag.

Process:
Pick locations and dates.
Change in the URL the dates so that you are "going back in time"

For this instance, let's pick Frankfurt ---> Vienna

Pick a 'Depart' date for 3 days from now, and the 'Return by' date to be 4 days later.
Press enter and let the page load.
Go to the URL and there, change the date of the 'to=' section to be 1 or 2 days before the 'from=' section, but still later from the current date.
Press enter and let the page load. 
After it loads you should get a 'An error occurred' message with the flag
