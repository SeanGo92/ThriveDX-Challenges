Challenge Description:
You are employed as a system administrator at the "Oxfredy" university. To share lesson files with students, Oxfredy established an SMB service in their network. 
Yesterday, a lecturer in Oxfredy tried to upload lesson files through the SMB service, but without success. 
Your task is to identify the most likely cause of the upload falure. You must make sure that the SMB service is restricted to authorized users only, to protect Oxfredy. 
Your goals: 
☛ Identify potential miconfigurations. 
☛ Configure the SMB service properly. 
☛ Read the data in the shared file.

Process:
We have 2 different stations: smbadmin@smb-srv & lecturer@Ubuntu. We will be working with smbadmin.
Using 'sudo -l' will show us that we have a few commands in out disposal:
User smbadmin may run the following commands on smb-srv:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service smbd restart
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service smbd stop
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service smbd start
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service smbd status

But trying to restart the service fails on start.
Upon checking the smb.conf file that is located in '/etc/samba/'. Let's edit the file and modify some things:
--> Edit 'server min protocol = SMB3' to 'server min protocol = lanman1'.
--> Add an '#' to comment the line 'security = share' because this is what has been preventing the service from properly restarting since it is obsolete.
--> Remove the '#' at the start of 'valid users' and change it from '%S' to 'smbuser'.
--> Go all the way down, and in the [lessons] section modify the following:
            'path = /home/smbuser/share/'
            'read only = no'

Save the conf file and close it.
Now the command 'sudo service smbd restart' should work just fine.
Go into the directory '/home/smbuser/share/' and inside you will find the lesson's text file with the flag inside
