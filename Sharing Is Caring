Challenge Description:
Proper permission management and access control have been a long-known issue in the IT department.
For a while now, you have been trying to convince the CISO that this issue needs handling.
Finally, he agreed to prioritize it, on the condition that you can provide him with a demonstration in which you compromise one of the company's machines.

Your goals
☛ To complete the task, you were provided with the user and password 'nicolas:pr1vt3st' to a server called 'avalanche-drp.'
☛ Use the provided credentials to connect to the target server and perform system enumeration.
☛ Escalate privileges to the Admin user.

Process:
This challenge is filled to the brim with red herrings.
Log into nicolas@avalanche-drp via ssh.
We will see that we have write permissions inside the 'admin's home directory, but cannot proceed beyond that. Let's create a '.ssh' directory and inside of it an empty 'authorized_keys' file.

Use 'ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f nicolas_key' to create a public and private key.
Use the command 'cat nicolas_key.pub | ssh nicolas@avalanche-drp "cat >> /path/to/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys" 'to print the public key inside the authorized_key file, therefore granting us access into the admin's user.

Run 'ssh -i [path to private key]admin@avalanche-drp' and you will find the key
