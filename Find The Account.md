# Find The Account
#### Blind SQLi, cookie manipulation
## Challenge Description:

In the California University of Bio-Medicine, the average final exam grades in the Biochemical 101 course were higher than what the lecturers expected. <br>
The university's chancellor thought there was something suspicious and asked to check the security cameras to determine if students cheated during the exam. <br>
The cameras provided no lead and no evidence of cheating was found. <br>
Unsatisfied with the findings, the chancellor insisted on hiring a security expert to check any other lead, including the possibility of a leak from the university's website.<br>

#### Your goals
â˜› To complete the task, you were provided with the following credentials: Username: TestAccount, Password: 33PTtest12@! <br>
â˜› Review the authorization of the California University of Bio-Medicine website.<br>
â˜› Find a way to escalate privileges and gain administrative access.<br>
â˜› Obtain the leaked exam by exploiting the web application.<br>

## Process:
When we first open the site, we are already greeted with the first clue, which is "This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website" <br>
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_01.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>
Let's login with the credentials we were provided and see where that leads us <br>
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_02.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>
Same site, but now we are logged in. If we check the cookies using the 'cookie editor' extension we can see that we have 'full_name', 'role' and 'token'. <br>
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_03.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>
Since we don't know how to proceed from here, let's run dirbuster on the site and see what we can find.<br>
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_04.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>
We found a directory named 'CMS' which is forbidden to us.
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_05.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>

In order to gain access to that section, let's change our cookies. In the 'role' tab, let's change it to 'teacher' and see what that gives us. <br>
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_06.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>
Great success!<br>
We can see that we can view student names, exam subjects and the teacher schedules. <br>
No comes the part of the SQLi. Let's start with the basics and see where that takes us. <br>
bla' OR 1=1 -- -
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_07.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>

Now we will start the blind injection and see how it goes. There is no need for me to make a screenshot of every step I made here so I will post the injections themselves and you are more than free to try them yourself<br>
<details> 
        <summary>The Injections</summary> 
          bla' UNION SELECT 1,schema_name,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FROM information_schema.schemata -- -<br>
          bla' UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='CUBM' -- -<br>
          bla' UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='tests' -- -<br>
          bla' UNION SELECT 1,link,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FROM CUBM.tests -- -<br>
    </details>
With the last command, we are presented with a table that has the 'FTA_Exam.pdf' file which is our target, but we can't reach or open it.<br>
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_08.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>
We can retrieve the file by editing the HTML of the page to "fix" the download button, but I find it easier to use the following SQL injection to modify the page: <br>
bla' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,link,6,7,8,9,10 FROM CUBM.tests -- -<br>
<br><p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/FindTheAccount_09.jpg"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>
Now all that is left for us to do is download the file, and we will be presented with our flag ðŸš©
