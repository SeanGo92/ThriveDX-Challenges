# CyJump

## Challenge Description:
Your friend Danny, who is taking a game development course, sent you his first web-based game.
Danny tried to fool you by sending an impossible-to-win version of the game.

Your goals
☛ Use the arrow keys [←, 1, →, ↓] and space bar to control the character within the game.
☛ Play the game and defeat the boss to complete the level.
☛ Reach the flag at the end of the game (hack it if necessary).

## Process:
Notice the URL of the game.
Tempering with it changes the game itself
In order to shoot faster, change 'delay_between_packets=18' to '0'
In order to jump over the high ledge, change 'jump=10' to '100'

Reach the end of the game, and you'll find the phrase (it changes each time)
