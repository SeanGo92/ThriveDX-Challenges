# I Am Listening
## Challenge Description:
﻿While searching for a job, you have checked the Acipher website's career page and found they are recruiting for a reverse engineering position.<br>
Upon applying, a bot of the Acipher careers system sent you an email with a challenge to decrypt a message. The email contains an encrypted message and an encryptor script written in Python.<br>

#### Your goals are:
☛ Open the encryptor.py file using the code editor.<br>
☛ Read the script and understand its flow.<br>
☛ Open the message.txt file using the code editor and decrypt the content.<br>

## Process:

The original script<br>
- [encryptor.py](https://github.com/SeanGordon92/ThriveDX-Challenges/blob/main/Resources/encryptor.py)<br><br>

The txt file we need to decrypt
- [message.txt](https://github.com/SeanGordon92/ThriveDX-Challenges/blob/main/Resources/message.txt)<br><br>

This is the completed reverse engineered scripts that will decrypt the txt file and print the flag.
