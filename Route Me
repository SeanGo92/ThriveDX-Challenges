Challenge Description:
Recent reports regarding delays in food container production of the "Plastic & Elastic" company led to several changes in the company's network topology.
The topology modification included new networking devices and permissions modifications.
As the company's security specialist, you were requested to verify that the new topology and hierarchy were established securely.
When considering the various cases, your main concern was a compromise of the main router in the network.

Your goals
☛ To perform the security evaluation without interrupting the production process, you were provided with an exact replica of the network, and access to 'R2', using the user and password 'Smith:DawaYk'.
☛ Find a way to compromise the router and access the Global Configuration Mode.
☛ Modify the router's configurations to enable access to the web server in the management network from the "tapdb-backup' Server.
☛ Verify the web interface of 'websrv-internal' can be accessed from 'tapdb-backup'.

Process:
Go to 'R2'. In the CLI press enter. Enter the user and password as seen above.
To gain password for 'enable' options, type 'show running-config'.
Take "080A4D42003B041B1B" and run it through 'https://packetlife.net/toolbox/type7/' to get the reversed password which is "KaliBali".

Execute 'show ip interface brief'.
Enter the config mode by executing 'config t' and then the following commands:
'interface gigabitEthernet 0/1'
'no shutdown'

Return to the main Cicso layout window, and enter the Server-PT.
Go into 'Desktop' tab and click 'web browser'.
In the URL enter the IP 192.168.1.5.
