# EnumUsers
## Challenge Description:<br>
A startup company created a new login page. Before publishing it, they gave you the task to perform penetration testing on their website and check if a non-existing user can log in as an admin user. 
#### Your goals: <br>
â˜› Find a way in to the admin account. 

## Process:
Inspect the page and use the username and password that are hidden as a remark.<br><br>

        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/EnumUsers_01.png"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>
<p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/EnumUsers_02.png"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br>

After logging into the user, we can inspect the page again and we will see this:<br>

<p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/EnumUsers_03.png"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br><br>
Add the '?secret=users' to the URL to look like this '/index.php?secret=users' and you will be presented with a list of all available users.<br>
<p align="center">
        <kbd align="center">
          <img src="Images/EnumUsers_04.png"/>
        </kbd> 
</p><br><br>
You can try using Burp Suite to get the correct response.<br>
You can also use the 'cookie editor' extention to edit the current name and uid of the user.<br>
The name we are looking for is 'chirrut' and the correct uid is 10.<br>

Upon changing them you will be presented with the flag
<details> 
        <summary>Hidden Flag</summary> 
          <p align="center">
